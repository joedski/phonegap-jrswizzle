phonegap-jrswizzle
==================

A "plugin" for Phonegap to add JRSwizzle to the iOS part of your project when you need that.

It's designed to be plugin play (hah hah hah) so have at it.


Installation
------------

Inside of your phonegap project, run this:

```
cordova plugin add https://github.com/joedski/phonegap-jrswizzle
```

You can probably use Plugman too.  I dunno.

Licenses
--------

The ... uh.  ... well, there's not really much here, is there?  JRSwizzle code is under MIT so there's that.  The plugin.xml doesn't really have anything copyright worthy in it, though, since anyone can arrive at that given form.  So whatever.
